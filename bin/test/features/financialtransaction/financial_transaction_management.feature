  As a new user
  I want to record my income and expense transactions
  So that I can keep track of my spending

  Scenario Outline: E2E-CP - Complete transaction registration flow
    Given the visitor registers with name "<name>", email "<email>", and password "<password>"
    When the user logs in with email "<email>" and password "<password>"
    And accesses the transactions module
    And registers a "<type>" transaction with description "<description>" for an amount of <amount> and date "<date>"
    Then the user should see the transaction "<description>" with amount <amount> in the list
